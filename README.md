### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
---
 EDA was used to answer some key questions about the data and exploring the data :-
 1. Difference between the attrition ratio of male and female employees.
 2. Which department has the highest rate of attrition ? 
 3. What is the average age of the employees working in the company ?
 4. What is the attrition rate for different age groups ?
 5. What kind of educational background does the employee who has left most likely to have ?
 
### Results/Findings
---
The analysis results are summarised as follows:
1. The attrition rate for the company is 16.12 % which can range between low to moderate in the industry.
2. The average age of employees in the company is 37.
3. Employees who are at lower job level are most likely to leave the company.
4. Employees who have lower average monthly income are likely to leave.
5. R&D Department has most number of employees.
6. Sales Department has the maximum attrition rate (20.63%) of all the departments.

### Recommendations

We need to conduct surveys and interviews in Sales department to find out the reason for high attrition rate among high job level employees.
